    "#### Description\n",
    "This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using Object-Oriented ‎Programming (OOP). \n",
    "It demonstrates **inheritance, protected and private members, method overriding**, ‎and **encapsulation.**\n",
    "The program manages two types of vehicles: **Car** and **Bike**. Each class inherits from a ‎base class Vehicle. \n",
    "A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its speed threshold.‎\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task Statement\n",
    "Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and ‎speed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.‎\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must:**‎\n",
    "‎1.‎\tCreate a base class Vehicle that stores vehicle type, name, and speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "‎2.‎\tUse **protected** and **private** attributes in the base class to demonstrate ‎encapsulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "‎3.‎\tImplement a method classify() that categorizes vehicles as **High-speed Vehicle** ‎if the speed is greater than 100, otherwise **Normal Vehicle**. \n",
    "\n",
    "‎4.‎\tDerive two subclasses — Car and Bike — from Vehicle. Each should override the ‎show_info() method to display detailed information. \n",
    "\n",
    "‎5.‎\tRead multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, ‎and print their details along with their classification results.‎\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "‎3‎\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Toyota 150‎\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike Yamaha 90‎\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Honda 120‎\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "Car Added: Toyota\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike Added: Yamaha\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Added: Honda\n",
    "\n",
    "‎--- Vehicle Details ---‎\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Car, Name: Toyota, Speed: 150 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Bike, Name: Yamaha, Speed: 90 km/h, Predicted: Normal Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Car, Name: Honda, Speed: 120 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Short Hint:\n",
    "Use a base class Vehicle with **protected** and **private** attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create subclasses Car and Bike that override show_info() and add a simple speed-‎based classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Speed above 100 is considered a \"High-speed Vehicle\".‎\n"
